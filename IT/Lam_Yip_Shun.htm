<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:15.0pt">Proposal for IT 
Express during year period 2003 ¡V 2004<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">IT Express will be published 3 times in 
coming year, the 1<sup>st</sup> release would be in early November, another one 
in February, after Lunar New Year, and the final one would be during the 
post-yearly-exam period.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This year¡¦s releases will be different 
from the past years. After reading past years¡¦ releases, it is found that 
there are quite some improvable points. They were with very good contents. 
However, there is quite some other information we can put in, to make the 
Express become even richer in content.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">To make the point simpler, I wish the 
new IT Express to include the following fields (not in publishing order):</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:18.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list 18.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span>Software Zone ¡V introducing some popular, useful softwares, or    
softwares which are recommended by the teachers/schools. (2 pages)</span></p>

</span>Hardware Zone ¡V introducing new, popular hardwares, maybe plus a    
teacher¡¦s choice. It also includes the news about hardware development. (2 to    
3 pages)</span></p>

technology, great global IT events, or upcoming trends. Sometimes it will    
include the international business column held. (1 to 2 pages)</span></p>

</span>Expert zone ¡V advanced techniques in different fields. For example,    
editing registry to remove unwanted softwares, setting to make your computer

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:18.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;

</span>Computer Q&amp;A<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(1 page)</span></p>   
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It would be totally 12 ¡V 16 pages,    
including the cover. (estimated only, it will fluctuate)</span></p>   
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">And now it comes to the selection of    
published data. As IT Express is mean of news, magazine, all information used    
should be considered of its usefulness, modernity, popularity and its    
¡§level¡¨. It must be done to ensure the issue is informative and interesting.    
Let me explain it point by point.</span></p>   
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">First of all, we speak of    
¡§usefulness¡¨. Obviously, it refers to how useful is the information towards    
the students. For instances, we have got articles about 2 softwares, Dreamweaver    
MX and Director MX, which one should be published?</span></p>   
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Under the usefulness principle, we would    
better have the Dreamweaver one. Although both are famous softwares by    
Macromedia, Dreamweaver will be more widely used among the students. And that is    
the reason for the choice.</span></p>   
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Modernity, it means the information    
should be up-to-date. This is simple, but it is also very important. No one will    
feel interested in an outdated stuff.</span></p>   
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When we talk about popularity, it means    
if the information we provided are of students¡¦ interest. Sometimes we shall    
publish something which students eager to know, in order to make the Express    
more attractive. For instance, we have got 2 news article. The 1<sup>st</sup>    
one is about the new digital camera, and the latter one is the new networking    
technology developed by Microsoft. Thus we should consider which one the    
students may be interested. Let¡¦s say they want the digital camera news this    
time, thus we should not publish that Microsoft article.</span></p>   
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Finally we should consider the    
¡§level¡¨ of the data, it refers to which if the article can be understood by    
most of our students. Consider the following paragraph about the NVIDIA GeForce    
FX 5900 Ultra:</span></p>   
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">¡§NVIDIA is introducing its follow-up    
product after the NV 30 video card. Following the company's nomenclature, the    
new high-end chip will be called NVIDIA GeForceFX 5900 (NV35).</span></p>   
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">There are several compelling reasons    
behind this surprising step. The previous flagship, the FX 5800 Ultra, was    
plagued by several problems. Due to the high clockspeed of 500 MHz and the new    
0.13-micron process, the yields for this chip were much lower than expected. The    
DDR-II memory it requires is expensive, not yet available in sufficient    
quantities and only supports a 128-bit bus, creating a memory bottleneck. On top    
of that, NVIDIA's reference cooling solution proved to be unacceptably loud,    
earning the reference card the nickname &quot;dustbuster.&quot; Lastly, the    
chip's image quality when using anisotropic filtering also didn't live up to    
expectations and was criticized in many reviews.¡¨</span></p>   
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Though the passage is clear and    
accurately points out the weakness of NVIDIA flagship, it is quite difficult for    
students to understand the idea inside. Thus we have to make it easier to    
understand:</span></p>   
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">¡§After the practical report of GeForce    
FX 5800 video card, NVIDIA moved on its pace to the follow-up product GeForce FX    
5900 (NV 35).</span></p>   
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The motive of this step is quite    
obvious. Tests and benchmarks have shown that, although FX 5800 is a fine    
product, there can be quite a lot of improvements. It was criticized by many    
reviews. Why hasn¡¦t it been successful? It was due to internal unbalance of    
chip settings. The central clockspeed is far too high (500 Mhz) when matched    
with other parts of the card. The DDR-II memory it requires is expensive and    
insufficient in supply, creating a bottleneck. What¡¦s more, its image quality    
didn¡¦t live up to expectation when anisotropic filtering (a kind of technology    
which helps to smooth the textures) is enabled. By optimizing FX 5800 chipsets,    
NVIDIA wish the new FX 5900 can again make itself the leader of the market.¡¨</span></p>   
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">We should be aware of it, because not    
all students are familiar with the formal wordings.</span></p>   
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In fact, besides content, the layout and    
the design of the Express are also important to attract readers. If the printing    
machine is capable of doing that, I would like to have a new layout. It is shown    
in the other attached file.</span></p>
